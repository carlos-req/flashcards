# Flashcards Challenge Codecademy

## About

Project developed as a challenge during the Front End Career Path Curriculum

## Goals

Test the React-Redux and Redux Tool Kit material learned.

- configure individual slices modules using createSlice() ; ('@reduxjs/toolkit')
- configure a store module wth configureStore() and the individual slice modules. ('@reduxjs/toolkit')
- use useSelector() in conjunction with the defined selectors in each individual state slices to access the Store; ('react-redux)
- create selector's to access the states for manipulation; ('react-redux')
- with useDispatch() dispatch actions to the store to update rendering; ('react-redux')
- understand the view => middleware => Action (dispatch) => view Redux workflow

# To Run

Run `npm start` in the project root and the app will be available on port 3000.

# State

The app's state is totally normalized, with slices for topics, quizzes, and cards.

# Routes

- `/new-topic` – form to create a new topic
- `/topics` – index of all topics
- `/topics/:topicId` – page for an individual topic
- `/new-quiz` – form to create a new quiz
- `/quizzes` – index of all quizzes
- `/quizzes/:quizId` – page for an individual quiz

# To Test

1. Create topics
2. Create quizzes
3. Visit the page for an individual quiz and flip the cards over

# Questions

Is this appropriately scoped? Does it have too many features? Too few?
